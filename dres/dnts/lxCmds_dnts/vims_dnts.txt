	- ^ , ~ needs obviously on DE-keyboard addiitonal space-bar /OR twice-entering as ^^ bzw. ~~ , to be realy sent/printed!!
	- ctrl-^ problem on non-US keyboards: use instead then ctrl-6 , maybe it works
	- also problems with certain keys as ~ , @ ,...(third-symbols) on non-us-keyoard, you need to press "space-button" too!
	- to check or see the results of any addressing, before doing anything:  :.,+3p (print out the selected lines) /OR .,/searchword/ > "a  (write to register a)
	- seperate all paragraphs with empty lines

	_______:  -- key-/cmd-prefixes/-suffixes  (ca., usually, ...; before/after other keys):
	- :w == :s == ctrl-W ..... : in new window

	--- converting unix-dos-formats by openning the file: see editing.txt :
		You can read a file in DOS format and write it in Unix format.  This will replace all <CR><NL> pairs by <NL> (assuming 'fileformats' includes "dos"):
		:e file ;   :set fileformat=unix   ;   :w

	- ]p	like p, but adjust indent to current line
	- no-indent by pasting (consider as simple text-paste)  :set paste
	- indent-adapttion by paste:  [p,]p,[gp,]gp : same as p,P... with indentation adaption to the current line
	- set: autoindent,(smartindent, cindent !?) showmatch, tabstop, shiftwidth, number, list (if then both: tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 ; tabstop;forTabs , shiftwidth:for>> )
	- indenting/shifting many lines:  [start-address]  > [count-of-lines]
	- NOT changing/adapting any indentations, just keep as it is:  :set paste  /OR  :set nosmartindent and noautoindent and -all-other-autoindentations
	- % will move the cursor backwards to the corresponding opening bracket character ( [ { < ...

	_______:  -- moving texts / delete-and-insert :

	- :copy  ,  :[range]co[py] {address}  : Copy the lines given by [range] to below the line given by {address}.
	- :move  ,  :[range]m[ove] {address}  : Move the lines given by [range] to below the line given by {address}. 
	- moving the lines from...to...:  :[range]m[ove] {address}  Move the lines given by [range] to below the line given by {address
	   eg. move 3 lines to the end of the file:  :.,+2mo $
	- moving a block by marks:  ma ; go to bloc-end and  :d'a ; go to target-position:  p
	- moving all lines in range to pos. before a mark: :'t+1,.g/^/m 't

	_______:  -- aligning/prosition-reformatting/reindenting text:    :h formatting , :h  auto-format  (in change.txt);
	- align centered the text   :[range]ce[nter]  , (default 'textwidth' or 80 when 'textwidth' is 0).
	- align right  :[range]ri[ght]
	-! align left (eg take out all indents):      :le
	- gq cmds (see insert), eg  gqq : realign current line , ...
	- beautifying codes ={motion} :reformats from . to {motion}; eg. gg=G beautifies whole code file!; or {Visual}=G after selecting...
	- converting all paragraphs into one-liners, if paragraphs seperated by empty lines(^$):  :g/./,/^$/join ; if not by empty, but blank lines (eg containing spaces)  :g/\S/,/^\s*$/join

	_______:  -- misc-change/...:
	- sorting the text:   :[range]sort[!] [i] ... (so shell sort piping ist not needed) see :h sorting
	-! remove duplicate lines and sort them:  :sort u   ;so only keep the first of a sequence of identical lines (ignoring case when [i] is used). see :h sort
	- abbreviations	 with :ab ; unabbreviate: :una word
	- print lines:  :print , :list (display unprintable characters) , :number (preceding with Line.No.)  :h :print , :h :list :
		:[range]p[rint] {count} [flags]  !!use for testing cmds!!
		eg print 5 lines, starting with line.No.20:  :20p 5  OR with line.no:  :20nu 5

    _______:  newline/EOL in substitutions/ex/...:
    - ! Use \r instead of \n:  Substituting by \n inserts a null character into the text. To get a newline, use \r. When searching for a newline, you’d still use \n, however.
    \n matches an end of line (newline), whereas \r matches a carriage return. On the other hand, in substitutions \n inserts a null character whereas \r inserts a newline (more precisely, it’s treated as the input CR).
    - so eg in vimrc for :nmap if wanted to substitude x with newline, then use \r instead \n !

	- filtering as cmd:  !5Gsort == :5,$ !sort   :do sorting for lines 5-End and write the sorted lines back to the buffer and so replace the current lines 5-End
	--- filtering-eg (pipe into the current buffer; ok with/without space before "!"):

	--- ! set VIM as default pager/viewer for manpages :   (from fedora docs,  /_191200 :  https://fedoramagazine.org/5-cool-terminal-pagers-in-fedora/ ): ---> but obviously still certain view-problems there !?!?:
		-  To set vim as the default pager for man pages, add the following to your shell’s config (such as ~/.bashrc if using the default bash shell):  export MANPAGER="/bin/sh -c \"col -b | vim -c 'set ft=man ts=8 nomod nolist nonu noma' -\""
		-! Alternatively, to set vim as the default pager system-wide, locate the less.sh script. (You can find it at /usr/share/vim/vim81/macros/ on current Fedora systems.) Export this location as the variable PAGER to set it as default, or under an alias to invoke it explicitly. ; so use locate less.sh

	_______:  -- patterns  ----> see full-listings in pattern.txt; here ONLY certain notes, NOT full-descriptions...:
	-!!diff: there ARE diffs for patterns-rules between search-string  <--->  replacement-string!! so certain interpretaions ($,\n\t,...) DIFFERS depend on if they appear in search- or replacement-string!!
	- ^ and $ have only at the beginning/End of RE special meanings, otherwise just normal chars (so spacing needed)
	-! use \> \< for complete word search/repl. instead space, as :%s/\<child\>/children/g
	- use POSIX ! (usually is supported) , see pattern.txt or :help [:digit:]
	--- search-string-patterns/specifies eg:
		- /ab\{3,5}/   :a{b 3-5 times}  ##--see :h  pattern-multi-items
		- a\(bc\)\{1,2}d     matches:     "abcd" or "abcbcd"
		- ab\{2,}c                "abbc", "abbbc", "abbbbc", etc.

	- linabreak \_ (can be combined with other classes), eg. \_. :matches any character or a line break. ; \_.* everything up to the end of buffer.
	- eg: \s :whitespaces/tab  \_s ;linebreak or whitespace/tab ; \_a :linebreak or alphabetics
	- linebreake;  \n ; match a space or a linebreak: \_s , any amount of white space: \_s\+  eg. \XX\_s\+yyyx`
	- eg: /"\_[^"]*" :text in double quotes splitted in several lines
	- eg: a number like 1MGU103 : /\d\u\u\u\d\d\d  /OR: /\d\u\{3}\d\{3} /OP: using ranges: /[0-9][A-Z]\{3}[0-9]\{3}

	_______:  -- magic  -->  :h /magic  in pattern.txt
	-!! special-char-interpretations in all search-patterns depend on "magic"-option-setting (default "magic"):
	   more "magic" means special-chars have more special-meanings and less literaly!
	   magic-flags: more special-chars-interpratations (so more magic) order:  \v > \m > \M > \V    ;see :h /magic
	   so with \V there is NO special-chars except "\" 
	   with \v ca. every non alnum-char is a special char and will be interpreted non-literaly!
	   which flag best for a case?: depends on the case; if cpecial-chars are more disturbing then use \V, if case needs more special-interpretations then use \v, or so ...
	-!! vim-recommended to always keep the 'magic' option at the default setting, which is 'magic'. for certain pattern then use explicitly the appropriate magic-flag!

	_______:  -- sorting:   --> :h sort
	- eg: sort on the second comma-separated field (:sort /pattern/):  :sort /[^,]*,/  ;the pattern-matched-part will be ignored by sorting!
	   the opposite of above, so sort ONLY considering the part up to the second comma:  :sort /[^,]*,/  r
	- eg: sort on only the first three letters of each line: > :sort /\a\a\a/ r
	- eg:  To sort on the first number in the line, no matter what is in front of it:  :sort /.\{-}\ze\d/  ; for {-}-syntax see :h pattern

	- ALT-key problem (<M-...) in gnome-terminal and konsole/suse  ; see :h :map-alt-keys
	   -!! gvim <---> vim and ALT-key: In the GUI Vim handles the Alt key itself, thus mapping keys with ALT should always work.  But in a terminal Vim gets a sequence of bytes and has to figure out whether ALT was pressed or not.
	   -! so do NOT use ALT for your mappings!

	-! NOT in all modes: Abbreviations are used in Insert mode, Replace mode and Command-line mode.
	- To avoid the abbreviation in insert mode (so insert it literarly): Type part of the abbreviation, exit insert mode with <Esc>, re-enter insert mode with "a" and type the rest.  Or type CTRL-V before the character after the abbreviation.
	- To avoid the abbreviation in Command-line mode (so insert it literarly): Type CTRL-V twice somewhere in the abbreviation to avoid it to be replaced.  A CTRL-V in front of a normal character is mostly ignored otherwise.

		A buffer is the in-memory text of a file (active/hidden/inactive buffers: a/h/''). A buffer is a file loaded into memory for editing.  The original file remains unchanged until you write the buffer to the file.
		A window is a viewport on a buffer.  A window is a viewport onto a buffer.  You can use multiple windows on one buffer, or several windows on different buffers.
		A tab page is a collection of windows. (eg ":sp #" divides a tab into two horizontal windows)
		A screen is a collection of tabs (your whole vim-session. kk)
		   A hidden buffer is not displayed in a window, but is still loaded into memory.  This makes it possible to jump from file to file, without the need to read or write the file every time you get another buffer in a window.

	- keys in omni-completion-listing-popup-windows (ctrl-X ...):
		- ctrl-x +  CTRL-E to stop completion and go back to the originally typed text
		- ctrl-x +  CTRL-Y to stop completion and accept the currently selected entry. pace, Enter, or some other unprintable character will leave completion mode and insert that typed character.
		- <Space> or <Tab>  Stop completion without changing the match
		- ctrl-x +  CTRL-N / CTRL-p / CTRL-o : next/prev/omni-func entry
