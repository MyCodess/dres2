    Parametrizing Fixtures:
    pytest will then call the fixture once each for every set of values we provide.
    Then downstream (compared with Parametrizing Functions): every test function that depends on the fixture will be called, once each for every fixture value.
    Fixture parametrization has the benefit of having a fixture run for each set of arguments. This is useful if you have setup or teardown code that needs to run for each test case ,maybe a different database connection, or different contents of a file, or whatever.
    - see also the other method with marker: @pytest.mark.parametrize: parametrizing test functions : see /how-to/parametrize.html#parametrizemark
